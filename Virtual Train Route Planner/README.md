# ðŸš† Virtual Train Route Planner

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

A **command-line train navigation system** that allows users to traverse stations forward and backward, 
simulate loop routes, and navigate in real-time. Designed using:

Doubly Linked List â†’ For bidirectional navigation (forward/backward)
Circular Linked List â†’ To model loop routes (e.g., metro rings)
Station tracking â†’ With current position and route display
Ideal for learning linked list variations and their real-world applications in
transportation systems.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Add train stations to a route
- Navigate forward and backward (using doubly linked list)
- Enable loop mode (circular route) â€” last station connects to first
- Display current station and full route
- Move to next/previous station with realistic feedback
- Toggle between linear and circular route modes
- Interactive menu with route visualization

  ## ðŸ“‚ Data Structures Used
- **Node** with name and position
- **Boolean flag** is_circular
- **Loop Route**->Tail node points back to head
